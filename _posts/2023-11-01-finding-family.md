What are we searching for? Most of us are lucky to have family, but as they say, you can't choose your family. One theory I'm entertaining is the search for community can be an attempt to heal family relationships. In essense, the search for meaningful connection can be driven by the deep desire to restore past connections.

Visiting family in Ukraine was the highlight of the whole trip. We stayed a month and could have easily stayed longer. From walking to play soccer with their cousin and the kids in the village, to the boys walking around the garden cradling chickens and following their babusya, to the serenity, inspiration, and love found with new 'family' in the hills of the Carpathians.

It was bittersweet as we couldn't escape another reality - guilt and sadness riding in a sleeping car with soldiers, able to relatively easily and safely travel all over Europe while they travel away from loved ones into unknown danger. Despair seeing the kids befriend and protect their new chicken friends... knowing life being wiped out a couple hundred kilometers away - expecting those who don't look like us and can't speak to us to be valued and treated with compassionsion while war and destruction of each other rages on.

🙏May we all find family - growing🌱 peace🕊️ in our selves🧘, our communities🏘️, and our world🌍
