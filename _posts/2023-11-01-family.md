What are we searching for? Most of us are lucky to have family, but as they say, you can't choose your family. One theory I'm entertaining is the search for community can be an attempt to try and heal family relationships. The search for meaningful connection can be connected to the deep desire to restore family relations.

Visiting family in Ukraine was the highlight of the whole trip. We stayed a month and could have easily stayed longer. I felt guilt and sadness riding in a sleeping car with soldiers, able to relatively easily and safely travel all over Europe. I felt despair seeing the kids try to befriend and protect chickens... knowing how human life is being wiped out in a war a couple hundred kilometers away. How can I expect animal rights, working for compassion for others who don't look like us and can't speak to us... when fellow human life is still so easily devalued and wasted.

May the peace in our hearts create peace in our families, our communities, and our world.
